# Express_JS_App_with_User_Authentication
I am learning fast, am I? This is an express App with user authentication using Facebook.

Okay, so, let me tell you how to use it. 

cd to the file directory and type npm install. 
Turn on your local MongoDB server and replace the local MongoDB url in the code with your own. 
Then cd to the file, and select node server.js

Head to localhost:8000/auth/facebook. 
If you log in successfully, voila. You've logged in using Facebook. 
It will be printed on the page, it is a success.
